passed:
  - no problem (list below) has been found

informational:
  - "tcp-listen-queue" in the options statement is set and it is less then 10
      -> solution + log slight risk
  - "zone-statistics" in the options statement is set with value "yes" or "no"
      -> solution + log slight risk

fixed:
  - (**) "pid-file" is not set with the "/run/named/named.pid" path
    "session-keyfile" is not set with the "/run/named/session.key" path
    already
    -> solution + log info
    -> the file that contains the option section is stored under the [0] dir
       and contains both statements with the values mentioned above
    -> it is applied on the target system automatically

neees_inspection:
  - a slave zone without "masterfile-format" statement is defined
      -> solution + log medium risk

needs_action:
  - empty zones are enabled (the "empty-zones-enable yes" inside the options
    statement) and there is enabled empty zone, that conflicts with built-in
    list of empty zones
      -> solution + log high risk


error:
  - options statement has not been found
  - configuration is broken
  - any configuration files cannot be opened for reading
  - main configuration file is missing

NOTE: priority is sorted from the top to down (error has the highest prio),
      result with lower prio cannot replace result with higher prio
