Brief summary of changes:
- content was renamed to 'notbase-channel'
- used log_error instead of log_high_risk before exit_error
- removed dependency on yum - instead of check of enabled repositories,
  check installed packages from optional repository and filter out packages
  which will be removed or moved to base repository on new system
- changed content title and description
- *debug packages are ignored totally
- print info about packages which are not part of base channel
- print info about needed 'provides' from subscriptions - under
  these provides should be available repositories which contains
  mentioned packages
- uses the newest API provided by preupgrade-assistant
- modified texts - added info about needed subcriptions for relevant packages
- kickstart files use CVS format now; added info about repo-id
- all files generated for kickstart starts with "RHRHEL7rpmlist_kept"
- files for kickstart contain only relevant information for the system
  - previously were included even packages which were not installed inside
    'RHRHEL7rmplist_kept' file
=============================================================================
Description for testing:
a) create list of native installed packages available in base repository on RHEL 7 [1]
   with format described below (second column is always empty, because it is not important
   information in this case, but can be simply added by two-line change if we want)
   - these packages should be installed always on new system

b) when a native package is available on RHEL 7 system but not inside base repository
   - when the package is in same (equivalent) repository on old and new system
     -> log high risk about package sinside channel (in case of optional channel is used just
        name "Optional" channel for all variants)
   - when the package is inside different repository on new system
     -> similar as above, just different log, which contains info like "moved to ..."
   - print info in remediation instructions with info about channel:
     pkg (<channel> channel)
     pkg (optional channel)
   - when the package is required by non-native package(s), additionaly insert info message like
     "(required by Non Red Hat signed package(s):pkg1 pkg2 ... pkgN)"
     -> used in all cases of b) above
   - always - store info into [2] with format described below

c) when any b) package exists and upgrade mode is enabled
   - print info/instructions for using of redhat-upgrade-tool (supported just base and optional)
   - when any package is in addon (not int base or optional channel), log high risk that other
     channels are not supported for inplace upgrade
d) when any b) package exists and migrate mode is enabled
   (unsupported scenario yet, but for completeness)
   - print info relevant for migration scenario with list of channels (names), that user needs
     covered by subscriptions to get needed repositories for all not-base packages
   - NOTE: used path to install_rpmlist.sh [3] is different in system installed by kickstart,
           but it is not supported yet and path is not provided by PA API yet
*) append info about kickstart files which this content could create into [4]
-------------
Format of files generated for kickstart:
<pkgname>|<required_by_not_native_pkg[ pkg]*>|<pkgname_on_RH7>|<repo-id>
# + supported comment lines like this one

e.g. (just imagined):
curl||curl|
git-all||git-all|rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
subversion-perl|some-pkg some-pkg2|subversion-perl|rhel-7-server-optional-rpms


- repo-id is empty when it is available in base channel [1]
- 1st nad 3rd columns are same because these packages are available on both systems

-------------
Exit results:
 - PASS - all installed native packages are available inside base repository on RHEL 7
 - FAIL - found at least one installed native package which is part of of other repositories on RHEL 7
 - ERROR - $COMMON_DIR doesn't exist or doesn't contain 'default'* files
           + log_error
         - or one of these tmp files wasn't created or is not readable (+ log_error):
           $AddonPkgs, $OptionalPkgs, $KeptBasePkgs, $DistNativePkgs

-------------
See [5] - separator ";", 3rd column contains repo-id, 4th "name of channel".
See functions in check script [6] (it_s easier for description):
  - print_base_files()
       -> to get list of files which contain list of kept packages available
          inside base repository of new system
  - print_opt_file_list()
       -> to get list of files which contain list of kept packages available
          inside optional repository of new system
  - print_addon_file_list()
       -> to get list of files which contain list of kept packages available
          inside not-base repositories of new system, excludes optional repository
  --- all exclude *debug* repositories
