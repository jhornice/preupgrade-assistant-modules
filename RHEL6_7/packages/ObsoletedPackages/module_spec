terminology: for correct understanding of the text below and content:
 - obsoleted = partially replaced by pkg(s) = replacement is not compatible
   - get from static data
=============================================================================
Description for testing:

a) when a native package is obsoleted on RHEL 7 system, it is available
   inside base repository and isn't required by any non-native package
   - add info into the solution file
   - add line in PSV format (below) into [1]

b) like a) but it is available inside different repository
   - add info into the solution file with message about different channel
   - add line in PSV format into [3]
   - when the package is in same (equivalent) repository on old and new system
     -> log_medium_risk about package inside not-base channel
   - when the package is inside different channel on new system
     -> log_medium_risk -> like above but different msg, which contains info
        like "moved to ..."

c) like a) but it is required by at least one non-native package
   - add info into the solution file with message about non-native packages
     which require this one (see below)
   - add line in PSV format into [2]
   - log_high_risk about that, including message like:
     "(required by Non Red Hat signed package(s):pkg1 pkg2 ... pkgN)"

d) combination of b) + c), just for clarification
   - log_high_risk
   - add line in PSV format into [4]

----------------
e) when any b) or d) package exists and migrate mode is enabled
   (unsupported scenario yet, but for completeness)
   - print info relevant for migration scenario with list of channels (names),
     that user needs covered by subscriptions to get needed repositories for
     all packages inside not-base repositories
   - NOTE: used path to install_rpmlist.sh [3] is different in system installed
           by kickstart, but it is not supported yet and path is not provided
           by PA API yet

*) append info about kickstart files which this content could create into [6]

-------------
Format of files generated for kickstart:
<pkgname>|<required_by_not_native_pkg[ pkg]*>|<obsoleted_by_pkg[ pkg]*>|<repo-id>
# + supported comment lines like this one

e.g. (just imagined):
grub||grub2|
tomcat6-javadoc||tomcat-javadoc|rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
pkgA|pkg1 pkg2 pkg3|pkgB1 pkgB2|rhel...

- repo-id is empty when it is available in base channel [1,2]

-------------
Exit results:
 - PASS - all installed native packages are not obsoleted by any package
          on RHEL 7
 - FAIL - found at least one installed native package which is obsoleted
          on RHEL 7
 - ERROR - $VALUE_RPM_RHSIGNED or $COMMON_DIR doesn't exist (+ log_error)
         - or one of these tmp files wasn't created or is not readable
           (+ log_error):
             $ObsoletedPkgs $MoveObsoletedPkgs $NotBasePkgs

-------------
See [7] - separator ";", 3rd column contains repo-id, 4th "name of channel".
