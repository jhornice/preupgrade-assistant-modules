- applicable when mysql or (or and? not sure here about behaviour) mysql-libs
  are installed - at least when any of them is installed, should be result
  NOT_APPLICABLE (maybe if missing one of them, ask phracek about it)

Backup and check config file /etc/my.cnf - and recusively all other config
files which are included through directives "!include" and "!includedir"
- if contains deprecated, removed or unsupported options/settings:

a) "plugin-load=innodb=" and doesn't contains "ignore-builtin-innodb":
 - print relevant info (contains relevant options) in solution file
 - log medium risk - file + message

b) "innodb_file_io_threads":
 - print relevant info in solution file
 - log high risk - file + message

c) "language\s*="
 - print relevant info in solution file
 - log high risk - file + message

d) "log-bin-trust-routine-creators" or "table_lock_wait_timeout":
 - print relevant info in solution file
 - log high risk - file + message

also try comment out these lines in backuped files and create 2 lists of files
which contains:
 - backuped files where all mentioned options are commented out
 - backuped files wehre at least one mentioned option is not commented out

On the end, print these two lists and append some recommendation, what he
should do with files above (when result FAILED).

Exit result:
 - INFORMATIONAL - mentioned options weren't found
 - FAILED - at least one of them was found
 - NOT_APPLICABLE (above)
