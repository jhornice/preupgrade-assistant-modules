========================
Description for testing:
When find some bumped library (below) in RH signed package:
a) when the package is required by some 3rd party packages
 - join this into to output message,
 - same info available inside [4]
 - and log risk
   -- MEDIUM - when used only mode migrate (--mode migrate)
   -- HIGH - otherwise

b) when library is available inside different package(s) on new system, add
   this info to output message - in this case, this info will be printed even
   in the case, that library is available inside 2+ packages and one of them
   is same like old package (may it's little more chatty)

c) when tha package is not required by any 3rd party package, print output
   message to [5] too

d) at least one is found - log medium risk that some bumped libs were found
   and exit result FAILED

Exit results:
 - PASS - not found any bumped library (irrelevant now probably)
 - FAIL - found at least one bumped library
 - ERROR - [2] or [3] don't exist (+ log error will be printed)

Bumped libraries
  - old library is not available anymore, but there is library with higher
    version. These are inside static lists. To get list of all relevant files,
    use:
# cd /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
# ls default*_soversioned*bumped*

[2] /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
[3] /var/cache/preupgrade/common/rpm_rhsigned.log
[4] /root/preupgrade/kickstart/SonameBumpedLibs-required
[5] /root/preupgrade/kickstart/SonameBumpedLibs-optional
