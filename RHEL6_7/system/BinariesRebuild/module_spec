Description for testing:
Find all executable binaries and scripts which are not tracked by any rpm and:
a) when it is binary, add it to file /root/preupgrade/kickstart/binaries
  - when depends only on safe libraries (below), add sufix message that can
    be used on new system without rebuild
b) when it is not binary, add it to file /root/preupgrade/kickstart/scripts

When some untracked binaries or scripts are found, print relevant
log_slight_risk and exit with result fail. Otherwise result pass.

Safe libraries are libraries which are available on new system. These are
inside static lists. To get list of all relevant files, use:
# cd /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
# ls default*_so*-kept default*_so*-moved_* default*_so*obsoleted

When common dir [0] or file [1] don't exist, log_error and exit with error.

[0] /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
[1] /var/cache/preupgrade/common/executable.log
