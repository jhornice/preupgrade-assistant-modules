========================
Description for testing:
Find all kept libraries from RH signed packages and print this to [1]. Then
find libraries, which are available on new system too, but inside different
package(s) or different repository and print to [1] too. Exit INFORMATIONAL.

When [2] or [3] don't exist, log error and exit error.

Both groups are separated in the file [1] by "comment".


Safe libraries are available available on old and new system. These are inside
static lists. To get list of all relevant files, use:
# cd /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
# ls default*_soversioned-kept default*_so-kept #kept libraries
# lsdefault*_so*-moved_* default*_so*obsoleted  # moved between repos/pkgs

[1] /root/preupgrade/kickstart/NoSonameBumpLibs
[2] /root/preupgrade/RHEL6_7/common
[3] /var/cache/preupgrade/common/rpm_rhsigned.log
